For the NIST CSF 2.0 control **RS.MA-05: The criteria for initiating incident recovery are applied**, hereâ€™s a straightforward explanation, the types of evidence you should expect, and examples of that evidence:

### Plain Language Summary
This control ensures that specific, predefined criteria are in place and followed to determine when to begin recovery efforts after an incident. These criteria help in deciding when it's safe and appropriate to start the recovery process to restore systems and operations to their normal state. Establishing clear criteria ensures that recovery begins at the right time, minimizing downtime and the risk of recurring issues.

### Expected Evidence
1. **Recovery Initiation Criteria Documentation**: Documented criteria that specify when and under what conditions the recovery process should be initiated following an incident.

2. **Training Records**: Documentation showing that personnel responsible for incident recovery are trained in understanding and applying these criteria.

3. **Incident and Recovery Logs**: Logs that include details about incidents and the subsequent recovery efforts, showing that recovery criteria were met before initiation.

4. **Audit Reports**: Reports from audits that assess the application of recovery initiation criteria, ensuring they are followed and effective.

5. **Review and Update Records**: Documentation of periodic reviews and updates to the recovery initiation criteria, ensuring they stay relevant and effective in light of evolving organizational needs and technological landscapes.

### Examples of Evidence
- **Recovery Criteria Policy**: A policy document detailing the specific conditions under which recovery should be initiated, including thresholds for system functionality, security verification, and risk assessment outcomes.
- **Training Attendance Log**: Records from training sessions focused on the recovery process, including who attended and when, ensuring that all relevant staff are knowledgeable about the criteria.
- **Sample Incident and Recovery Log Entry**: An entry from an incident log that shows the assessment against the recovery criteria and the decision to initiate recovery, including details of the incident severity, impact assessment, and readiness for recovery.
- **Internal Audit Summary on Recovery Practices**: A summary from an internal audit reviewing how recovery initiation criteria are applied, noting any discrepancies and suggesting improvements.
- **Policy Review Documentation**: Documents from the most recent review of the recovery criteria, showing any changes made to the policy and the reasons for those changes.

By maintaining robust controls and comprehensive documentation for the application of recovery initiation criteria, organizations can ensure that the transition from incident response to recovery is timely and effective. This structured approach helps minimize the impact of incidents by ensuring that systems and operations are restored promptly and safely.
