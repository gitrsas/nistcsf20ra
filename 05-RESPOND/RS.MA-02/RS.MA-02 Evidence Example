For the NIST CSF 2.0 control **RS.MA-02: Incident reports are triaged and validated**, hereâ€™s a straightforward explanation, the types of evidence you should expect, and examples of that evidence:

### Plain Language Summary
This control ensures that when an incident report is received, it undergoes a process of triage to prioritize it based on urgency and impact, and then it is validated to confirm the accuracy of the report. This step is crucial in managing the response effectively, as it helps allocate resources to more critical incidents first and ensures that the response efforts are based on verified information.

### Expected Evidence
1. **Incident Triage and Validation Procedures**: Documented procedures that detail the steps taken to triage and validate incident reports. This includes criteria for prioritization and methods used for validation.

2. **Training Records**: Documentation that personnel responsible for triaging and validating incident reports are properly trained in these procedures.

3. **Incident Logs**: Logs that capture the details of each reported incident, including the triage category assigned, the validation process undertaken, and the outcome of the validation.

4. **Audit Reports**: Reports from audits that assess the effectiveness of the triage and validation process, ensuring it works as intended and complies with organizational policies.

5. **Quality Assurance Reviews**: Records from periodic quality checks that review the accuracy and consistency of the triage and validation processes.

### Examples of Evidence
- **Triage and Validation Policy Document**: A document that outlines how incident reports are processed, including the specific criteria used to assess the severity and authenticity of incidents.
- **Training Certificates for Incident Response Team**: Certificates or records showing that the incident response team has been trained on the latest triage and validation procedures.
- **Sample Incident Log Entry**: An example of an incident log entry showing the initial report, the triage decision, steps taken to validate the incident, and the final determination.
- **Internal Audit Summary**: A summary from an internal audit reviewing the triage and validation processes, highlighting any issues found and recommendations for improvements.
- **Quality Assurance Review Report**: A report detailing the findings from a recent quality assurance review of the incident triage and validation process, including any discrepancies noted and corrective actions taken.

By maintaining robust controls and comprehensive documentation for triaging and validating incident reports, organizations can ensure that their response efforts are focused and effective, based on accurate and prioritized information. This systematic approach is critical for managing incidents efficiently and mitigating potential damages effectively.
