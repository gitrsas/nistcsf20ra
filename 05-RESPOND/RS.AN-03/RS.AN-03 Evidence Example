For the NIST CSF 2.0 control **RS.AN-03: Analysis is performed to establish what has taken place during an incident and the root cause of the incident**, hereâ€™s an explanation, the types of evidence you should expect, and examples of that evidence:

### Plain Language Summary
This control focuses on conducting thorough analysis after an incident to understand exactly what happened, how it happened, and why it happened. This involves investigating the sequence of events, identifying the vulnerabilities exploited, and determining the root cause of the incident. Understanding these details is crucial for preventing similar incidents in the future by addressing underlying issues and strengthening security measures.

### Expected Evidence
1. **Incident Analysis Procedures**: Documented procedures that outline the steps for conducting incident analysis, including methodologies for tracing the sequence of events and identifying root causes.

2. **Training Records**: Documentation that personnel responsible for incident analysis are properly trained in forensic and root cause analysis techniques.

3. **Incident Reports with Analysis**: Detailed incident reports that include a comprehensive analysis of the incident, findings on what occurred, how it occurred, and the identified root causes.

4. **Tools and Technologies Used**: Information on the forensic tools, software, and other technologies used in the analysis process, demonstrating how they aid in understanding the incident.

5. **Audit Reports**: Reports from audits that evaluate the effectiveness of the incident analysis process, including how well root causes are identified and addressed.

### Examples of Evidence
- **Incident Analysis Guidelines**: A document that specifies the approach and techniques used for incident analysis, ensuring a systematic and thorough investigation.
- **Forensic Training Completion Certificates**: Certificates or records indicating that analysts have completed specific training in forensic analysis and root cause determination.
- **Sample Incident Report**: An example of an incident report that includes a detailed analysis section, showing the incident timeline, the investigative methods used, and the conclusions about the root cause.
- **Forensic Tool Usage Logs**: Logs or documentation showing how forensic tools were used in a specific incident analysis, including outputs and results that helped identify the root cause.
- **Post-Incident Review Summary**: A summary from a post-incident review meeting, discussing the findings from the incident analysis and recommendations for preventing future incidents based on the root cause analysis.

By maintaining robust controls and comprehensive documentation for incident analysis, organizations can ensure they not only respond to incidents effectively but also gain insights that lead to stronger security practices and reduced risk of future incidents. This thorough analysis is vital for continuous improvement in security posture and operational resilience.
