For the NIST CSF 2.0 control **RS.AN-06: Actions performed during an investigation are recorded, and the records' integrity and provenance are preserved**, hereâ€™s a straightforward explanation, the types of evidence you should expect, and examples of that evidence:

### Plain Language Summary
This control ensures that all actions taken during the course of an incident investigation are meticulously documented. It also requires that the integrity and origin (provenance) of these records are protected to ensure they remain accurate and tamper-proof. This documentation is crucial for later analysis, potential legal proceedings, or regulatory compliance reviews. It ensures transparency in the investigation process and safeguards the reliability of the findings.

### Expected Evidence
1. **Investigation Recording Procedures**: Documented procedures that detail how actions in an investigation should be recorded, including the tools and formats used for documentation.

2. **Integrity Protection Measures**: Information on the security measures in place to ensure the integrity and provenance of investigation records, such as cryptographic signatures, access controls, or audit trails.

3. **Training Records**: Documentation showing that personnel involved in investigations are trained on the importance of accurate record-keeping and the methods to ensure record integrity.

4. **Sample Investigation Logs**: Examples of investigation logs that illustrate how information is recorded and preserved. These logs should show timestamps, actions taken, by whom, and any changes made to the records.

5. **Audit Reports**: Reports from audits that verify the adherence to documentation procedures and the effectiveness of integrity and provenance safeguards.

### Examples of Evidence
- **Incident Documentation Policy**: A policy document that outlines how to document investigation activities and the methods used to secure these documents.
- **Data Integrity Verification Records**: Records showing how the integrity of investigation records is checked and verified, including the tools and processes used.
- **Training Completion Certificates**: Certificates indicating that staff have been trained on the procedural and technical aspects of maintaining investigation records.
- **Investigation Log Entry**: An actual log entry from an investigation showing detailed information on the actions performed, including data collection, analysis conducted, and conclusions drawn.
- **Internal Audit Summary**: A summary from an internal audit focusing on the management of investigation records, detailing compliance with the policy and the effectiveness of the integrity protections.

By maintaining robust controls and comprehensive documentation for recording and preserving the integrity of actions during investigations, organizations ensure that their investigative processes are transparent, reliable, and defensible. This approach is critical for establishing accountability, supporting decision-making, and upholding legal and regulatory requirements.
