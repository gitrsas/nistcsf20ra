For the NIST CSF 2.0 control **RS.CO-03: Information is shared with designated internal and external stakeholders**, hereâ€™s a straightforward explanation, the types of evidence you should expect, and examples of that evidence:

### Plain Language Summary
This control ensures that specific, relevant information about incidents or security postures is shared with both internal and external stakeholders who have defined roles in the organization's security framework. This includes sharing updates, threat intelligence, and details of security breaches with parties such as internal teams, partner organizations, regulatory bodies, or law enforcement, as appropriate. Effective information sharing enhances collective defense and response strategies and helps meet compliance and regulatory requirements.

### Expected Evidence
1. **Information Sharing Policies and Protocols**: Documented guidelines that specify what information should be shared, with whom, under what circumstances, and through what channels.

2. **Training Records**: Documentation showing that personnel involved in information sharing are trained on these protocols, including confidentiality and security measures.

3. **Records of Shared Information**: Logs or records that detail the information shared with stakeholders, including the date, the type of information, the recipient, and the purpose of sharing.

4. **Audit Reports**: Reports from audits that assess the effectiveness of the information sharing practices, verifying compliance with policies and data protection laws.

5. **Feedback and Improvement Reports**: Documentation of feedback received from stakeholders regarding the shared information and any subsequent improvements made to the sharing protocols.

### Examples of Evidence
- **Information Sharing Policy Document**: A policy document that outlines the procedures for sharing information with internal and external stakeholders, including data sensitivity classifications and approved communication methods.
- **Training Session Summaries**: Summaries from training sessions provided to staff on the proper handling and sharing of sensitive information.
- **Sample Information Sharing Log**: An actual log entry showing an instance of information shared with a partner organization, including what was shared, why, and under what security measures.
- **Internal Audit Summary**: A summary from an internal audit reviewing the information sharing practices, noting any non-compliance issues and recommendations for enhancements.
- **Stakeholder Feedback Form**: A form or report compiling stakeholder feedback on the usefulness and appropriateness of the information received, including suggestions for improvement.

By maintaining robust controls and comprehensive documentation for sharing information with designated stakeholders, organizations can ensure that critical security information is disseminated effectively and securely. This promotes a collaborative approach to security and compliance, enhancing the overall resilience of both the organization and its network of partners and regulators.
