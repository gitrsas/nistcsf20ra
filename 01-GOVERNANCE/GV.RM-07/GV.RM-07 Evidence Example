For the control GV.RM-07 from the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0, which states that "Strategic opportunities (i.e., positive risks) are characterized and are included in organizational cybersecurity risk discussions," here's how it can be understood and applied for COMPANY X. This control focuses on ensuring that the organization not only manages threats but also identifies and leverages potential opportunities arising from cybersecurity practices.

Understanding GV.RM-07
This control means that COMPANY X should not only look at cybersecurity as a way to prevent problems but also as a chance to find and use opportunities that can help the company. For example, adopting new security technologies might not only protect against threats but also improve system efficiency or customer trust.

Expected Evidence

Cybersecurity Strategy Document:
  A document that includes both defensive measures against threats and proactive strategies that leverage cybersecurity for organizational benefit.
    Example: A strategic plan that outlines how adopting secure cloud services can improve data accessibility and customer satisfaction, enhancing the company's competitive edge.

Meeting Minutes and Strategic Discussion Records:
  Records from meetings where both cybersecurity risks and opportunities are discussed. This shows that the organization considers cybersecurity as a strategic asset.
    Example: Minutes from a strategy session where the IT team proposes the use of advanced authentication methods that can improve both security and user experience.

Risk and Opportunity Register:
  A register that includes not just threats and their mitigations but also potential opportunities and the strategies to capitalize on them.
    Example: A risk and opportunity register that lists potential benefits of implementing a new cybersecurity framework, such as compliance with new regulations that open up new markets.

Training and Communication Materials:
  Materials that communicate not only how to mitigate risks but also how to recognize and act upon opportunities that arise from the cybersecurity landscape.
    Example: Training modules for staff that include recognizing opportunities for innovation in cybersecurity practices that could lead to new service offerings.

Simple Explanation
Imagine COMPANY X is like a castle. Protecting the castle from invaders (cyber threats) is crucial, but itâ€™s also important to look out from the towers to see new lands to explore (strategic opportunities). For example:

  If they build a new, secure bridge (adopt new secure technologies), not only does it keep enemies out, but it also allows allies (customers) easier access, making them more likely to visit (do business with them).

  During meetings where the leaders discuss how to protect the castle, they also talk about where they can build new towers or bridges that might help them grow stronger or richer.

  They keep a big book (register) that lists all the possible dangers but also marks down where they think there might be hidden treasures or new paths to explore thanks to their strong walls and alert guards.

  They teach everyone in the castle not just how to fight off invaders but also how to spot and use these opportunities, like using a new type of lookout tower (innovative cybersecurity technology) that might attract more friendly traders.

This way, cybersecurity becomes a tool not just for defense but for growth and innovation, helping the company not only stay safe but also thrive and find new chances to succeed.
