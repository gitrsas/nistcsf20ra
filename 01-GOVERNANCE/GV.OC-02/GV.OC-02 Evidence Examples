### Control Overview
**GV.OC-02: Internal and external stakeholders are understood, and their needs and expectations regarding cybersecurity risk management are understood and considered**

This control focuses on identifying and understanding the various stakeholders connected to a healthcare payer company, including both internal personnel and external partners like vendors or clients. It emphasizes the importance of understanding their specific cybersecurity needs and expectations, which is crucial for effective risk management and maintaining trust.

### Evidence Expected
For this control, the following types of evidence should be collected to demonstrate compliance:

1. **Stakeholder Analysis Documents**: Detailed records identifying key stakeholders (both internal and external), their roles, and their specific cybersecurity needs and concerns.
2. **Communications Records**: Evidence of ongoing communication with stakeholders regarding cybersecurity matters, such as emails, newsletters, or meeting notes.
3. **Cybersecurity Policy Reviews**: Documentation showing stakeholder involvement in reviewing and shaping cybersecurity policies to ensure they meet their needs.
4. **Feedback Mechanisms**: Evidence of tools or systems in place to gather feedback from stakeholders about cybersecurity practices, concerns, and suggestions.

### Examples of Evidence
- A stakeholder map or database that includes categories like employees, vendors, partners, and clients, along with notes on their cybersecurity-related requirements and concerns.
- Minutes from meetings with stakeholder groups where cybersecurity risks and strategies are discussed.
- Surveys or feedback forms designed for stakeholders to provide input on their security concerns or experiences related to cybersecurity measures.
- Reports summarizing stakeholder feedback and how it has been integrated into cybersecurity planning and policy making.

### HIPAA Security Rule Cross-Reference
Cross-referencing this control with the HIPAA Security Rule involves:

- **Security Management Process (§ 164.308(a)(1))**: This section requires covered entities to identify and analyze potential risks to ePHI, incorporating stakeholder feedback into risk assessments can ensure all relevant risks are considered.
- **Information Access Management (§ 164.308(a)(4))**: Ensuring that appropriate access to ePHI is granted based on the role of the stakeholder, supporting both the need for confidentiality and the stakeholder’s expectations for access.

This control ensures that the cybersecurity framework within a healthcare payer organization considers and aligns with the diverse requirements and expectations of all stakeholders involved, thereby enhancing the overall security posture and compliance with applicable regulations.
