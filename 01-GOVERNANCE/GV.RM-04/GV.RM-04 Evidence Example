For the control GV.RM-04 from the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0, which states that "Strategic direction that describes appropriate risk response options is established and communicated," here's how you can understand and apply it for COMPANY X, a healthcare payer company. This control emphasizes the importance of having a clear plan that outlines how to deal with various types of risks, including cybersecurity risks, and ensuring that this plan is known across the organization.

Understanding GV.RM-04
This control means that the company should have a clear set of guidelines or a plan that tells everyone what to do if different types of risks happen, like cyber attacks or data breaches, and that this plan is shared with all the right people in the company.

Expected Evidence

Strategic Risk Management Plan:
  A document that details the companyâ€™s strategy for responding to risks, including identification, assessment, response, and monitoring of risks.
    Example: A strategic risk management plan document that includes sections specifically addressing how to respond to cybersecurity threats, such as steps to take in case of a data breach or a cyber attack.

Communication Records:
  Evidence showing that the risk management strategy has been communicated to relevant stakeholders within the organization.
    Example: Emails, memos, or newsletters sent to department heads or the entire organization outlining the strategic risk management approach and specific actions to take for managing cybersecurity risks.

Training Materials:
  Training programs or materials that help employees understand their roles in implementing the risk management strategy, particularly how to respond to cybersecurity incidents.
    Example: Slides or handouts from a training session that explain what employees should do if they suspect a cybersecurity threat or breach.

Meeting Minutes and Presentations:
  Records from meetings where the risk management strategy was discussed or presented, showing that strategic directions and response options are regularly reviewed and updated.
    Example: Minutes from a board meeting or a risk management committee meeting where the strategic direction for managing cybersecurity risks was discussed and agreed upon.

Simple Explanation
Imagine the company is like a team playing a big game. Just like a coach has a playbook that tells players what to do in different situations in the game, COMPANY X needs a playbook (strategic risk management plan) for what to do if problems (risks) happen. This playbook tells everyone from the top bosses to the newest employee how to handle things like someone trying to steal patient information. It's important that everyone knows about the playbook and understands their part, just like players need to know the plays to work well as a team. They talk about the playbook in meetings, train on it, and even send out updates when they add new plays.
