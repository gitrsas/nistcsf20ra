For the control GV.RR-03 from the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0, which states that "Adequate resources are allocated commensurate with the cybersecurity risk strategy, roles, responsibilities, and policies," here’s how it can be understood and applied for COMPANY X. This control focuses on ensuring that the organization allocates sufficient resources—such as funding, personnel, and tools—to effectively manage cybersecurity risks according to its established strategy and roles.

Understanding GV.RR-03
This control means that COMPANY X should ensure it has enough resources (money, staff, tools) dedicated to cybersecurity, matching the level of risk they face and the responsibilities outlined in their policies. It's about making sure that the cybersecurity team has what it needs to do its job well.

Expected Evidence

Budget Allocation Documents:
  Financial documents that show funding specifically set aside for cybersecurity initiatives, tools, staff salaries, and training programs.
    Example: A section of the annual budget detailing expenditures on cybersecurity, including investments in new technologies, ongoing maintenance costs, and cybersecurity personnel.

Resource Planning and Assessment Reports:
  Reports that assess the adequacy of current resources against the cybersecurity needs of the organization.
    Example: An annual cybersecurity resource assessment report that evaluates whether current staffing levels and technological tools are sufficient to meet the strategic goals outlined in the cybersecurity policy.

Staffing Records:
  Documentation that shows the organization has employed enough qualified personnel to cover all cybersecurity roles and responsibilities.
    Example: HR records showing the number of cybersecurity positions filled versus the number required as per the organizational strategy.

Training and Development Records:
  Records of ongoing training and professional development opportunities for cybersecurity staff, ensuring they remain proficient in their roles.
    Example: Logs of completed training sessions, certifications obtained by staff, and budgets allocated for attending cybersecurity conferences and workshops.

Technology and Tools Inventory:
  An up-to-date inventory of cybersecurity tools and technologies that the organization uses, showing investments in necessary upgrades and maintenance.
    Example: An inventory list that includes the purchase dates, maintenance schedules, and upgrade plans for security software and hardware.

Simple Explanation
Imagine COMPANY X as a castle that needs defending. The castle walls (cybersecurity measures) need to be strong, and the guards (cybersecurity team) need to be well-equipped and well-trained.

  Just like a castle needs enough soldiers and the right weapons to defend it properly, COMPANY X needs to make sure it spends enough money and hires enough skilled people to protect its computer systems and data.

  They need to check regularly (through assessments and reports) to make sure they always have what they need as new threats appear and things change.

  They also need to keep their tools sharp and ready (through updates and maintenance) and ensure their guards are always learning new defense tactics (through training and development).

  The leaders of the castle (senior management) must make sure that part of their treasure (budget) is always set aside to keep the walls strong and the guards ready.

This approach ensures that the castle is always prepared to face any threats and that the people inside feel safe because they know they're well protected.
