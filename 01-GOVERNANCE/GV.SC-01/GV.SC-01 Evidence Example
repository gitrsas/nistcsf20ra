For the control GV.SC-01 from the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0, which states that "A cybersecurity supply chain risk management program, strategy, objectives, policies, and processes are established and agreed to by organizational stakeholders," here's how it can be understood and applied for COMPANY X. This control is about ensuring a comprehensive approach to managing risks that arise from third-party relationships and supply chain interactions.

Understanding GV.SC-01
This control means that COMPANY X needs to establish a structured program to address cybersecurity risks associated with its supply chain. This includes risks from vendors, service providers, and any other third parties involved in the organization’s operations. The program should be well-documented and should have clear objectives, strategies, policies, and procedures that are agreed upon and supported by stakeholders within the organization.

Expected Evidence

Cybersecurity Supply Chain Risk Management (C-SCRM) Program Documentation:
  Official documents that detail the scope, objectives, and requirements of the C-SCRM program. These documents should outline how the organization identifies, assesses, manages, and monitors cybersecurity risks from third parties.
  Example: A C-SCRM policy manual that includes methodologies for vendor risk assessment, ongoing monitoring strategies, and protocols for handling breaches or incidents related to third-party services.

Stakeholder Agreement Records:
  Evidence that key stakeholders have reviewed, contributed to, and agreed on the C-SCRM program and its components. This might include signatures, meeting minutes, or formal approvals from department heads, management, and the board of directors.
    Example: Minutes from meetings where the C-SCRM strategy was discussed and approved by senior management, along with records of approvals or endorsements from the board.

Communication and Training Materials:
  Materials used to communicate the details of the C-SCRM program to relevant employees, especially those who interact directly with suppliers or manage vendor relationships.
  Example: Training slides and handouts used in workshops for employees involved in procurement, IT, and security operations that explain their roles in implementing the C-SCRM strategy.

Compliance and Monitoring Reports:
  Regular reports that evaluate the effectiveness of the C-SCRM program and compliance with its policies. These reports help identify areas where the program might need adjustments or enhancements.
  Example: Quarterly or annual compliance reports that assess vendor adherence to security requirements and the effectiveness of risk mitigation measures.

imple Explanation
Think of COMPANY X’s supply chain cybersecurity like managing a team in a relay race:

  Setting Up the Rules: Just as a coach outlines strategies and rules for a race, COMPANY X develops a plan (C-SCRM program) that defines how to manage and secure all the exchanges between the company and its suppliers—like passing the baton in a relay race.

  Getting Everyone on Board: Before the race, the coach and team members agree on the strategy. Similarly, COMPANY X ensures that all key players in the organization understand and support the cybersecurity supply chain strategy.

  Training the Team: In a relay race, each runner needs to know how to take and pass the baton securely. In the company, employees involved in supply chain management are trained on how to handle data and services securely, ensuring smooth and safe transactions.

  Watching the Race: Just as a coach watches the race to see if the strategy works or needs adjustments, COMPANY X regularly checks how well its supply chain security measures are working and makes improvements as needed.

By having a well-defined and agreed-upon C-SCRM program, COMPANY X ensures that its interactions with third parties do not expose the organization to undue cybersecurity risks, much like a well-prepared relay team reduces the chances of dropping the baton.
