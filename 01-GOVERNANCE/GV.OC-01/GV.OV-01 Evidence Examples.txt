### Control Overview
**GV.OC-01: The organizational mission is understood and informs cybersecurity risk management**

This control ensures that everyone in the healthcare payer organization understands its core mission and how it drives cybersecurity practices. The main idea is to make sure cybersecurity efforts align with what the organization is trying to achieve overall, ensuring protection efforts support critical business functions and patient data security.

### Evidence Expected
For this control, you should collect evidence showing that the organizational mission and cybersecurity efforts are aligned. This includes:

1. **Documented Organizational Mission Statement**: This foundational document should clearly state the organization’s mission and be easily accessible to all employees.
2. **Cybersecurity Policy Documents**: These should reference the organizational mission and describe how cybersecurity supports this mission.
3. **Meeting Minutes or Memos**: Records from strategic planning meetings where the organizational mission is discussed in the context of cybersecurity planning and initiatives.
4. **Training Materials**: Any training provided to staff should include references to how cybersecurity practices are designed to protect and further the organizational mission.

### Examples of Evidence
- A copy of the official organizational mission statement that outlines the goals and objectives of the healthcare payer company.
- Cybersecurity strategy documents that explicitly mention how the strategy supports the organization's mission.
- Records from board meetings or strategic sessions where the alignment of cybersecurity initiatives with the organizational mission is discussed.
- Training presentations or handouts that link cybersecurity behaviors and protocols directly to protecting the core functions and data crucial to the organization’s mission.

### HIPAA Security Rule Cross-Reference
The HIPAA Security Rule requires covered entities to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of all electronic protected health information (ePHI) they create, receive, maintain, or transmit. Aligning the organizational mission with cybersecurity can be cross-referenced with several aspects of the HIPAA Security Rule, especially:

- **Administrative Safeguards (§ 164.308)**: This includes conducting a risk analysis to identify threats to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of ePHI, and implementing security measures to reduce these risks to a reasonable and appropriate level.
- **Risk Management (§ 164.308(a)(1)(ii)(B))**: Requires covered entities to implement security measures sufficient to reduce risks and vulnerabilities to a reasonable and appropriate level, supporting the organizational mission to protect patient information.

This control emphasizes understanding and integrating the organization's mission throughout the cybersecurity framework, ensuring that all security measures support and enhance the core objectives of the organization.
