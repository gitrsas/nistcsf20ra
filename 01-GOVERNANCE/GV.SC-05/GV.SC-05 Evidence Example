For the control GV.SC-05 from the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0, which states that "Requirements to address cybersecurity risks in supply chains are established, prioritized, and integrated into contracts and other types of agreements with suppliers and other relevant third parties," here’s how it can be understood and applied for COMPANY X. This control focuses on the formal inclusion of cybersecurity requirements in all dealings with suppliers and other third parties to mitigate risks associated with the supply chain.

Understanding GV.SC-05
This control means that COMPANY X should ensure that specific cybersecurity requirements are clearly outlined, prioritized based on risk, and included in all legal and formal agreements with suppliers and other third parties. This approach ensures that all parties are legally obligated to adhere to defined cybersecurity standards, which helps protect the organization from potential vulnerabilities introduced through the supply chain.

Expected Evidence

Contractual Clauses for Cybersecurity:
  Copies of contracts with suppliers that include specific cybersecurity clauses. These clauses should detail the security measures that suppliers are required to implement, such as compliance with certain security standards, regular security audits, and incident reporting procedures.
  Example: Sample contract sections that specify requirements for encryption, data security standards, and the right to audit the supplier for compliance.

Risk-Based Prioritization of Requirements:
  Documentation showing how cybersecurity requirements in contracts are prioritized based on the level of risk associated with each supplier. Higher-risk suppliers might have more stringent cybersecurity requirements in their contracts.
  Example: A risk assessment matrix that categorizes suppliers based on the sensitivity of the data they handle or their access to the organization’s systems, with corresponding differences in contract requirements.

Integration and Oversight Processes:
  Procedures that describe how cybersecurity requirements are integrated into the procurement process and how compliance with these requirements is monitored and enforced.
  Example: Procurement process documents that include steps for integrating cybersecurity assessments into supplier evaluations and ongoing compliance monitoring plans.

Training and Communication Materials:
  Training programs and communication materials that educate procurement and contract management teams on the importance of cybersecurity requirements and how to ensure they are included in all agreements.
    Example: Training session outlines and materials that cover the key cybersecurity clauses to be included in contracts and the rationale behind these requirements.

Simple Explanation
Think of COMPANY X as a fortress that needs to ensure all doors (suppliers) are secure:

  Setting the Rules for Each Door: Just as a fortress might require different levels of security checks at different doors depending on their location and importance, COMPANY X sets specific cybersecurity rules for each supplier. These rules are detailed in contracts and vary in strictness based on how critical the supplier is and how much risk they pose.

  Making Sure Rules Are Followed: Just as guards at a fortress would regularly check that each door's locks are working as required, COMPANY X has processes to regularly check that suppliers are meeting their cybersecurity obligations. This might involve audits or requiring suppliers to report on their security measures.

  Educating the Gatekeepers: Just like training the fortress’s guards on what to look for during their checks, COMPANY X ensures that the teams responsible for procurement and managing supplier relationships understand the cybersecurity requirements and know how to ensure they are included in all agreements.

By incorporating specific cybersecurity requirements into contracts and ensuring they are prioritized and enforced based on risk, COMPANY X effectively extends its cybersecurity defenses to include its supply chain, thus mitigating risks from external sources.
