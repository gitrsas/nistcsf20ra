For the control GV.RR-02 from the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0, which states that "Roles, responsibilities, and authorities related to cybersecurity risk management are established, communicated, understood, and enforced," here's how it can be understood and applied for COMPANY X. This control emphasizes the importance of clearly defining and enforcing the cybersecurity roles within the organization.

Understanding GV.RR-02
This control means that COMPANY X needs to clearly outline who is responsible for what in terms of managing cybersecurity risks. It’s crucial that these responsibilities are well communicated to everyone, easily understood, and followed strictly.

Expected Evidence

Organizational Charts and Role Descriptions:
  Detailed documents and charts that clearly outline who is responsible for each aspect of cybersecurity within the organization.
    Example: An organizational chart that includes roles such as Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), IT security analysts, and other cybersecurity team members, along with detailed job descriptions that list specific cybersecurity responsibilities.

Communication Records:
  Evidence that the information about roles and responsibilities has been properly communicated to all relevant staff.
    Example: Emails or internal newsletters that introduce the cybersecurity team and explain the roles of each member, ensuring that all employees know whom to contact for cybersecurity issues.

Training Programs:
  Programs that train employees on their roles and responsibilities regarding cybersecurity, ensuring they understand what is expected of them.
    Example: Orientation sessions for new hires that include training on cybersecurity practices, or ongoing training sessions that keep all employees aware of their responsibilities.

Compliance and Enforcement Mechanisms:
  Systems in place to ensure that roles and responsibilities are not only understood but also adhered to.
    Example: Regular audits or reviews that check if employees are fulfilling their cybersecurity duties as defined, and documentation of any disciplinary actions taken when responsibilities are not met.

Simple Explanation
Think of COMPANY X like a hospital where everyone from the doctors to the nurses to the administrative staff has specific roles to play. In terms of cybersecurity:

  Just like in a hospital, where doctors, nurses, and other staff each have specific duties, in COMPANY X, specific people are responsible for certain parts of keeping information safe. For example, the CISO is like the head surgeon for cybersecurity—they oversee everything related to keeping data secure.

  The hospital (company) makes sure everyone knows their roles by telling them when they start working there, through training that is like the medical training doctors and nurses go through, and reminders in emails or meetings, just like medical staff might be reminded of hygiene practices.

  Everyone has to follow the rules about who does what. If someone doesn’t do their part in keeping information safe, just like if a doctor didn’t follow the rules for a surgery, there are systems to correct that. This might mean more training or other steps to make sure it doesn’t happen again.

By making sure everyone knows and follows their roles, COMPANY X ensures that their 'hospital' runs smoothly and safely, protecting patients' (customers’) information just like doctors protect patients’ health.
