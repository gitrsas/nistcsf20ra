For the NIST CSF 2.0 control **DE.CM-01: Networks and network services are monitored to find potentially adverse events**, hereâ€™s an explanation in straightforward language, the types of evidence you should expect, and examples of that evidence:

### Plain Language Summary
This control ensures that your organization continuously monitors its networks and network services to detect any unusual or suspicious activities that could indicate a security threat. Monitoring involves tracking all network traffic and analyzing it for signs of unauthorized access, data breaches, malware infections, or any other activities that could harm the organization. Effective network monitoring helps in early detection of threats, allowing for timely responses to protect data and systems.

### Expected Evidence
1. **Network Monitoring Policies and Procedures**: Documentation outlining the strategies and methods used for monitoring network traffic, including the types of events that are logged, how data is analyzed, and how alerts are managed.

2. **Monitoring Tool Configurations and Logs**: Configuration details of the network monitoring tools used (such as intrusion detection systems, firewalls, and traffic analysis software) and logs generated by these tools that record network activity.

3. **Incident Reports**: Documentation of any network security incidents detected through monitoring, including the nature of the event, how it was discovered, the response actions taken, and the outcome of those actions.

4. **Regular Review and Update Records**: Records showing that the monitoring tools and procedures are regularly reviewed and updated to adapt to new security threats and changes in the network architecture.

5. **Training Records**: Evidence that staff responsible for network monitoring are trained in the latest network security and monitoring techniques and understand how to effectively use the monitoring tools.

### Examples of Evidence
- **Network Monitoring Policy Document**: A formal policy that specifies how network monitoring is conducted, what metrics are important, and how alerts should be handled.
- **Intrusion Detection System (IDS) Logs**: Logs from an IDS that show detected suspicious activities, including timestamps, the nature of the activity, and the network segments affected.
- **Security Incident Response Report**: A detailed report of a specific incident identified through network monitoring, detailing the timeline, mitigation steps, and lessons learned.
- **System Update Logs**: Logs or reports showing updates to monitoring tools or adjustments to configurations in response to new security threats or after an incident.
- **Network Security Training Certificates**: Certificates or records of training sessions attended by network security personnel, showing dates and the content of the training.

By maintaining strict controls and thorough documentation for network monitoring, organizations can detect and respond to potential security threats more effectively. This proactive approach is essential for safeguarding the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of organizational data and systems.
