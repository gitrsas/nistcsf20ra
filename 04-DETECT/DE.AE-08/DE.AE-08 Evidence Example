For the NIST CSF 2.0 control **DE.AE-08: Incidents are declared when adverse events meet the defined incident criteria**, here’s a breakdown in plain language, the types of evidence you should expect, and examples of that evidence:

### Plain Language Summary
This control ensures that when certain predefined criteria of adverse events are met, such as specific signs of a security breach or failure, these are formally recognized as incidents. Having clear criteria for what constitutes an incident helps organizations respond promptly and effectively. This involves documenting what triggers an incident declaration and ensuring that all relevant team members are aware and prepared to act according to the incident response plan.

### Expected Evidence
1. **Incident Declaration Criteria Documentation**: Policies or guidelines that clearly define what types of events are considered incidents and the thresholds or conditions that trigger an official incident declaration.

2. **Incident Logs and Reports**: Records of declared incidents, detailing when, how, and why each incident was declared, demonstrating adherence to the predefined criteria.

3. **Training Records for Incident Response Team**: Documentation showing that the incident response team is trained to recognize and declare incidents based on the established criteria.

4. **Incident Response Plans and Procedures**: Detailed plans that outline the steps to be taken once an incident is declared, ensuring a coordinated and effective response.

5. **Audit Reports**: Reports from audits reviewing the incident declaration process, assessing whether incidents are declared appropriately according to the defined criteria.

### Examples of Evidence
- **Incident Criteria Policy Document**: A document that details the specific conditions under which an adverse event is escalated to an incident, including examples of such conditions like multiple failed login attempts, detection of malware, or unauthorized access to sensitive data.
- **Sample Incident Report**: An actual incident report that includes a detailed account of the event, how it was identified, assessed, and declared, aligning with the organization’s incident criteria.
- **Training Agenda and Attendance Log**: Records from a training session for the incident response team focusing on recognizing and declaring incidents, including dates and participant names.
- **Response Procedure Flowchart**: A flowchart or other visual aid that outlines the steps to be taken when an incident is declared, available to the incident response team.
- **Compliance Audit Summary**: A summary from the latest compliance audit that evaluates how well incidents are declared in accordance with the established criteria, including any recommendations for improvements.

By maintaining robust controls and comprehensive documentation for declaring incidents, organizations ensure that they can respond swiftly and effectively to security threats, minimizing potential damages and disruptions. This systematic approach to recognizing and declaring incidents is crucial for maintaining operational integrity and security.
