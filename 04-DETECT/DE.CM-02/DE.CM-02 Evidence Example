For the NIST CSF 2.0 control **DE.CM-02: The physical environment is monitored to find potentially adverse events**, here’s a straightforward explanation, the types of evidence you should expect, and examples of that evidence:

### Plain Language Summary
This control ensures that the physical spaces where critical infrastructure and data are housed (like data centers, server rooms, and offices) are continuously monitored to detect and respond to potential security threats or environmental hazards. Monitoring could include surveillance cameras, access control systems, environmental sensors (such as smoke detectors and water leak sensors), and security personnel. The goal is to quickly identify and mitigate risks like unauthorized access, theft, fire, or water damage that could impact the organization’s operations.

### Expected Evidence
1. **Physical Security Policies and Procedures**: Documented policies that outline how physical monitoring is conducted, including what security measures are in place, how they are maintained, and how incidents are responded to.

2. **Monitoring System Logs**: Logs from surveillance cameras, access control systems, and environmental monitoring devices that record entries, exits, and any detected anomalies within the physical environment.

3. **Incident Reports**: Documentation of any physical security incidents, detailing what happened, how it was detected, the response actions taken, and the outcome of those actions.

4. **Maintenance Records**: Logs showing regular maintenance checks and updates to physical security systems to ensure they are functioning properly and remain effective.

5. **Security Audit Reports**: Reports from periodic audits that assess the effectiveness of physical monitoring controls and suggest improvements if necessary.

### Examples of Evidence
- **Physical Security Plan**: A comprehensive document that details all physical security controls, monitoring practices, and response procedures.
- **Access Log Entries**: Records from an access control system showing entry and exit logs, including date, time, and badge details of personnel accessing secure areas.
- **CCTV Footage Reports**: Summaries or clips from CCTV footage capturing specific events of interest, such as unauthorized access attempts or detection of environmental hazards.
- **Environmental Monitoring Alerts**: Records of alerts from environmental sensors, such as high temperature, smoke detection, or water leakage, including the time of the alert and the response initiated.
- **Physical Security Audit Summary**: A summary from the latest security audit reviewing the physical security measures, highlighting any incidents, breaches, and the efficacy of the surveillance and monitoring systems.

By maintaining robust controls and comprehensive documentation for physical environment monitoring, organizations can protect their critical infrastructures from physical threats and environmental hazards, ensuring operational continuity and security.
