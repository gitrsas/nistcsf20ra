For the NIST CSF 2.0 control **DE.AE-06: Information on adverse events is provided to authorized staff and tools**, here’s a clear explanation, the types of evidence you should expect, and examples of that evidence:

### Plain Language Summary
This control ensures that information regarding security incidents or adverse events is promptly shared with the right people and systems within the organization that are authorized to handle it. This enables a coordinated and effective response by ensuring that all relevant parties are informed and equipped with the necessary data to take action. The process includes defining who should receive information, how it should be securely transmitted, and how to use this information in response tools and protocols.

### Expected Evidence
1. **Information Sharing Policies and Procedures**: Documented guidelines that specify how information about adverse events is distributed within the organization, including the roles authorized to receive such information and the communication channels used.

2. **Access Control and Distribution Logs**: Logs that record the distribution of information about adverse events, showing who accessed the information and when.

3. **Training Records for Relevant Staff**: Documentation showing that staff members who receive and handle information on adverse events are properly trained on their responsibilities and the procedures for managing such information.

4. **Integration Records for Security Tools**: Evidence showing how information on adverse events is integrated into security tools, enhancing their ability to respond to or mitigate such events.

5. **Audit Reports**: Reports from audits that assess the effectiveness of the information sharing system, ensuring that it meets security standards and is compliant with the organization’s policies.

### Examples of Evidence
- **Information Sharing Policy Document**: A document that outlines the process for sharing information about adverse events, including protocols for secure transmission and recipient roles.
- **Incident Notification Logs**: Detailed logs showing how notifications about specific incidents were distributed among the authorized personnel and response systems.
- **Security Staff Training Logs**: Records from training sessions that include incident information management, focusing on confidentiality, integrity, and proper handling of sensitive data.
- **System Configuration Screenshots**: Screenshots or reports showing how security information systems are configured to receive and use data from incident reports to trigger alerts or updates.
- **Compliance Audit Summary**: A summary from the latest compliance audit that reviews the information sharing practices related to adverse events, noting any gaps and recommending improvements.

By maintaining robust controls and comprehensive documentation for the dissemination of information on adverse events, organizations can ensure a timely and coordinated response to security incidents. This proactive communication strategy is crucial for minimizing the impact of adverse events and enhancing the overall security posture of the organization.
