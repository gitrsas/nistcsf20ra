For the NIST CSF 2.0 control **RC.RP-02: Recovery actions are selected, scoped, prioritized, and performed**, here’s a straightforward explanation, the types of evidence you should expect, and examples of that evidence:

### Plain Language Summary
This control ensures that the actions taken during the recovery phase are carefully chosen, clearly defined, appropriately prioritized, and effectively executed. The goal is to ensure that recovery efforts are efficient and targeted, focusing first on the most critical systems and services to minimize impact on the organization's operations. Proper scoping and prioritization help allocate resources effectively and speed up the recovery process.

### Expected Evidence
1. **Recovery Planning Documents**: Detailed documentation on how recovery actions are planned, including criteria for selecting, scoping, and prioritizing these actions.

2. **Training Records**: Records showing that personnel involved in recovery are trained on the processes for selecting, scoping, and prioritizing recovery actions.

3. **Execution Logs**: Logs that detail the execution of recovery actions, including what actions were taken, by whom, when, and their outcomes.

4. **Audit Reports**: Reports from audits that assess whether recovery actions were appropriately selected, scoped, prioritized, and performed according to the plan.

5. **Review and Improvement Reports**: Documentation from post-recovery reviews that assess the effectiveness of the recovery actions and suggest improvements for future incidents.

### Examples of Evidence
- **Recovery Strategy Document**: A document that outlines the organization’s approach to recovery, including how to assess the impact of incidents and determine which systems or services are recovered first.
- **Training Session Summaries**: Summaries or records of training sessions provided to recovery personnel, focusing on the methodology for recovery planning and execution.
- **Sample Recovery Action Log**: An example of a detailed log from a recent recovery effort, showing how actions were prioritized and executed, including time stamps and personnel assignments.
- **Post-Incident Audit Summary**: A summary from a post-incident audit that evaluates the selection, scope, prioritization, and execution of recovery actions, highlighting any gaps and recommendations.
- **After-Action Review Report**: A report from an after-action review that analyzes the recovery process for a specific incident, evaluating the effectiveness of the recovery actions and lessons learned.

By maintaining robust controls and comprehensive documentation for planning and executing recovery actions, organizations ensure that their recovery processes are effective and that they can quickly return to normal operations after an incident. This control is critical for minimizing the duration and impact of disruptions on business activities.
