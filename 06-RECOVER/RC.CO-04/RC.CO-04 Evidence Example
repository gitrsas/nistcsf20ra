For the NIST CSF 2.0 control **RC.CO-04: Public updates on incident recovery are shared using approved methods and messaging**, here’s a straightforward explanation, the types of evidence you should expect, and examples of that evidence:

### Plain Language Summary
This control ensures that when communicating with the public about an incident and its recovery, the organization uses predefined, approved methods and messaging. This is crucial for maintaining control over the narrative, ensuring accurate and consistent information, and protecting sensitive data. It helps manage public perception, legal risks, and regulatory compliance.

### Expected Evidence
1. **Public Communication Policy**: Documented guidelines that define how to communicate with the public during incident recovery, including approved messaging templates and communication channels.

2. **Training Records**: Documentation showing that personnel responsible for public communications are trained on the approved methods and messaging.

3. **Records of Public Communications**: Copies of public updates issued during incident recovery, demonstrating adherence to the approved methods and messaging.

4. **Audit Reports**: Reports from audits that review public communications during incident recovery, assessing adherence to the policy and effectiveness of the communication.

5. **Feedback and Impact Reports**: Documentation of feedback received from the public and analysis of the impact of public communications on the organization’s reputation and incident resolution.

### Examples of Evidence
- **Approved Messaging Guidelines Document**: A detailed outline of the key messages, tone, and information to be communicated to the public during incident recovery, including templates for press releases or social media updates.
- **Training Completion Certificates**: Certificates or records indicating that relevant staff have been trained in public communication strategies and the specific guidelines for incident recovery messaging.
- **Sample Public Announcement**: A copy of a public announcement made during a recent incident recovery, showing the use of approved messaging and communication channels.
- **External Audit Summary on Public Communications**: A summary from an external audit that evaluates the organization's public communication practices during incident recovery, noting any discrepancies from approved procedures.
- **Public Relations Impact Analysis**: A report analyzing the public’s response to the communications issued during recovery, assessing the effectiveness and any areas for improvement.

By maintaining robust controls and comprehensive documentation for public communications during incident recovery, organizations ensure that they can effectively manage public perceptions and legal or regulatory risks. This controlled approach to communication is critical for maintaining trust, credibility, and operational stability in the wake of an incident.
