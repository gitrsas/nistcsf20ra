For the control ID.IM-02 from the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0, which states that "Improvements are identified from security tests and exercises, including those done in coordination with suppliers and relevant third parties," here’s how it can be understood and applied for COMPANY X. This control focuses on the necessity of conducting security tests and exercises not only internally but also in collaboration with suppliers and third parties to identify and implement improvements in the organization's cybersecurity practices.

Understanding ID.IM-02

This control emphasizes the importance of using security testing and exercises as tools to detect vulnerabilities and inefficiencies in cybersecurity protocols, both within COMPANY X and across its supply chain. By including suppliers and third parties in these activities, the organization can ensure a more comprehensive security posture, recognizing that its cybersecurity defenses are only as strong as the weakest link in its extended network.

Expected Evidence

Security Testing and Exercise Plans:
  Documented plans for regular security tests and exercises, including those that involve suppliers and third parties. These plans should detail the scope, objectives, and frequency of these tests and exercises.
    Example: Annual plans for penetration testing, disaster recovery drills, and incident response exercises that include roles and responsibilities for both internal teams and participating third parties.

Collaboration Agreements:
  Agreements or MOUs with suppliers and third parties that outline their involvement in security tests and exercises. These documents should specify how these activities will be coordinated and how data and findings will be shared.
    Example: Agreements with IT service providers that include clauses mandating their participation in joint incident response drills and the conditions under which test results will be shared.

Reports from Security Tests and Exercises:
  Detailed reports documenting the outcomes of security tests and exercises. These reports should identify successes, failures, vulnerabilities, and areas for improvement.
    Example: Post-exercise reports that analyze the performance of both COMPANY X and its suppliers in a simulated data breach scenario, highlighting areas where communication or response strategies could be enhanced.

Improvement Tracking Documents:
  Records that track the implementation of improvements identified from security tests and exercises. This should include timelines for implementation, responsible parties, and status updates.
    Example: An improvement action list derived from recent security tests, including deadlines for addressing each identified issue and the parties responsible for each action.

Feedback and Review Mechanisms:
  Mechanisms for collecting and reviewing feedback from all participants in security tests and exercises, including internal staff and third-party contributors.
    Example: Feedback forms distributed after a joint security exercise, and a review meeting to discuss the feedback and how the exercise could be improved in the future.

Simple Explanation
Think of COMPANY X’s approach to identifying improvements through security tests like a team sport where practice drills involve not only the team players but also their key support staff and coordinators:

  Regular Drills and Practices: Just as a sports team regularly practices to find weaknesses in their strategies and improve, COMPANY X conducts security tests and exercises to identify vulnerabilities in their cybersecurity defenses.

  Involving External Coaches: Similar to how a team might invite external coaches to provide fresh perspectives during practice, COMPANY X includes suppliers and third parties in security exercises to ensure all aspects of the supply chain are robustly tested.

  Analyzing Performance: After each practice session, just as a team reviews what went well and what didn’t, COMPANY X and its partners analyze the results of security tests to pinpoint areas needing improvement.

  Implementing Changes: Like a sports team making strategic changes after practice reviews, COMPANY X implements changes to its cybersecurity measures based on exercise outcomes.

  Continuous Improvement: Just as athletes continue to train and improve over time, COMPANY X continuously refines its security practices through regular testing and collaboration with partners.

By conducting and learning from security tests and exercises, especially those involving critical third parties, COMPANY X ensures that improvements are continually identified and implemented, enhancing the overall security and resilience of the organization and its extended network.
