For the control ID.RA-02 from the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0, which states that "Cyber threat intelligence is received from information sharing forums and sources," here’s how it can be understood and applied for COMPANY X. This control is about the organization actively obtaining and utilizing cyber threat intelligence from various external sources to enhance its awareness and readiness against current and emerging cyber threats.

Understanding ID.RA-02

This control means that COMPANY X needs to engage with external sources of cyber threat intelligence to stay informed about the latest cybersecurity threats, trends, and vulnerabilities. By participating in information sharing forums and subscribing to threat intelligence feeds, the organization can proactively adjust its security posture and defenses in response to new information.

Expected Evidence

Subscriptions to Threat Intelligence Feeds:
  Documentation of subscriptions to various cyber threat intelligence services that provide real-time alerts, analyses, and reports on emerging cybersecurity threats and trends.
    Example: Contracts or subscription details with providers like the Multi-State Information Sharing & Analysis Center (MS-ISAC), Sector-Based Information Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISACs), or commercial threat intelligence services.

Membership in Information Sharing Forums:
  Evidence of membership in forums or organizations where information on cybersecurity threats and best practices is shared among members, often specific to certain sectors like healthcare.
    Example: Membership certificates or participation records in sector-specific forums such as the Health Information Sharing and Analysis Center (H-ISAC).

Internal Reports Based on External Intelligence:
  Reports generated internally that summarize and analyze information gathered from threat intelligence sources, tailored to the organization’s specific context and security needs.
    Example: Monthly or quarterly cybersecurity intelligence reports that assess how external threats could impact COMPANY X’s operations and what measures should be considered.

Integration with Security Operations:
  Documentation showing how cyber threat intelligence is integrated into the organization’s security operations, including how alerts are processed and responded to.
    Example: Procedures that detail the steps for integrating threat intelligence into the organization’s Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system or incident response processes.

Training and Awareness Programs:
  Records of training sessions that educate relevant staff on how to interpret and utilize cyber threat intelligence effectively.
    Example: Training records for cybersecurity team members that cover the sources of threat intelligence, methods for analyzing intelligence, and how to apply this information in operational security practices.

Simple Explanation
Think of COMPANY X’s approach to managing cyber threat intelligence like a weather-sensitive event planning:

  Weather Forecasts: Just as an event planner subscribes to weather alerts to anticipate and prepare for potential storms, COMPANY X subscribes to cyber threat intelligence feeds to stay ahead of potential cybersecurity threats.

  Community Group Chats: Like joining local community groups where people share quick updates about the weather in different areas, COMPANY X participates in information sharing forums to gain insights from and contribute to collective security knowledge.

  Event Adjustments Based on Forecasts: Just as an event planner might adjust plans based on the latest weather forecast, COMPANY X uses information from cyber threat intelligence to adjust its cybersecurity measures.

  Briefing the Team: Similarly, just as the event staff are briefed on potential weather issues and response strategies, COMPANY X trains its staff on how to understand and react to intelligence alerts to protect the organization effectively.

By actively receiving and utilizing cyber threat intelligence, COMPANY X enhances its capabilities to preemptively address emerging threats, thereby strengthening its overall cybersecurity posture.
