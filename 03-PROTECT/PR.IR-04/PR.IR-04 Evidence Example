For the NIST CSF 2.0 control **PR.IR-04: Adequate resource capacity to ensure availability is maintained**, here’s a straightforward explanation, expected evidence, and examples of that evidence:

### Plain Language Summary
This control ensures that your organization has enough resources (like computing power, storage, and network capacity) to maintain system availability at all times. This means making sure there is sufficient infrastructure to handle expected and unexpected demands, thereby preventing system overloads, slow performance, or downtimes. Strategies may include scaling resources, using cloud services to manage load dynamically, and continuously monitoring resource usage to anticipate needs.

### Expected Evidence
1. **Capacity Planning Documents**: Policies and procedures that outline how capacity planning is conducted, including methods for forecasting demand, criteria for adding new resources, and approaches for handling peak loads.

2. **Resource Utilization Reports**: Regular reports that track the usage of resources such as CPU, memory, storage, and bandwidth. These reports help in identifying trends and planning for future needs.

3. **Performance Monitoring Logs**: Logs from monitoring tools that track the performance of IT systems, ensuring that they operate within the defined capacity limits and identifying any potential capacity issues before they affect system availability.

4. **Scalability Testing Results**: Documentation from tests designed to determine the system's ability to scale up or down based on demand. This includes load testing results and the effectiveness of auto-scaling systems if used.

5. **Audit Reports**: Reports from internal or external audits that review the organization’s resource management and capacity planning practices, verifying that they effectively support system availability.

### Examples of Evidence
- **Capacity Management Policy**: A document that details the organization's approach to managing IT resource capacity, including guidelines for when and how resources should be expanded.
- **Resource Utilization Graphs**: Graphs or charts derived from system monitoring tools that show trends in resource usage over time, helping to predict future requirements.
- **Cloud Service Dashboard Screenshots**: Screenshots from cloud service dashboards showing current resource allocations and usage levels, as well as settings for automatic resource scaling.
- **Load Testing Protocol and Results**: A report outlining a recent load testing exercise, including the methodology used, the load applied, how the system responded, and any actions taken to address deficiencies.
- **IT Infrastructure Audit Summary**: A summary from the latest audit that focuses on capacity management, noting any potential risks and the actions recommended or taken to mitigate them.

By maintaining robust controls and comprehensive documentation for managing IT resource capacity, organizations can ensure high availability and performance of their systems. This proactive management is crucial for supporting business continuity, user satisfaction, and operational efficiency.
