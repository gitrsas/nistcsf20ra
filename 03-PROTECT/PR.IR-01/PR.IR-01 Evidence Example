For the NIST CSF 2.0 control **PR.IR-01: Networks and environments are protected from unauthorized logical access and usage**, here's a breakdown in simple terms, the types of evidence you should expect, and examples of that evidence:

### Plain Language Summary
This control ensures that your organization's networks and computing environments are safeguarded against unauthorized access and misuse. It involves setting up barriers and controls that verify the identity and permissions of users or systems before they can access network resources. Techniques include using firewalls, intrusion detection systems, access controls, and secure authentication methods to protect sensitive data and systems.

### Expected Evidence
1. **Network Security Policies and Procedures**: Documented policies and procedures that outline how network security is managed, including access control measures, network segmentation strategies, and the use of security technologies like firewalls and intrusion detection systems.

2. **Access Control Lists (ACLs)**: Configuration details showing how access to different parts of the network is restricted based on roles and responsibilities. These lists define who can access what resources within the network.

3. **Network Security Device Configurations**: Documentation or screenshots showing the settings of firewalls, routers, switches, and other network devices that are configured to restrict unauthorized access.

4. **System and Network Monitoring Logs**: Logs from network monitoring tools that show the detection of and response to unauthorized access attempts. This evidence demonstrates active monitoring and the effectiveness of the network's defensive measures.

5. **Audit Reports**: Reports from internal or external audits that assess the network's vulnerability to unauthorized access and the effectiveness of the implemented security controls.

### Examples of Evidence
- **Network Security Policy Document**: A comprehensive document that outlines the organization's approach to network security, including user authentication requirements, data encryption standards, and incident response procedures.
- **Firewall Configuration Snapshots**: Screenshots from the firewall management interface showing rules that block unauthorized traffic or limit access to sensitive parts of the network.
- **Access Control Configuration Reports**: Reports from systems like Active Directory or network management tools detailing user groups, roles, and the permissions assigned to each, ensuring that access is tightly controlled.
- **Intrusion Detection System (IDS) Alerts**: Examples of alerts generated by an IDS when potential unauthorized access attempts are detected, illustrating the system's ability to identify and respond to threats.
- **Network Security Audit Summary**: A summary report from a recent network security audit that evaluates how well the network resists unauthorized access, with recommendations for improvements if necessary.

By maintaining robust controls and keeping detailed records of how networks and environments are protected, organizations can effectively mitigate risks associated with unauthorized access, ensuring the security and integrity of their critical IT infrastructure.
