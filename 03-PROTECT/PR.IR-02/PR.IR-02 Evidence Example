For the NIST CSF 2.0 control **PR.IR-02: The organization's technology assets are protected from environmental threats**, here's a detailed breakdown in plain language, the types of evidence you should expect, and examples of that evidence:

### Plain Language Summary
This control ensures that your organization's technological assets, such as servers, data centers, and network devices, are safeguarded against environmental risks like floods, fires, earthquakes, power outages, and extreme temperatures. The goal is to prevent damage that could lead to data loss or service disruptions. Protective measures might include installing environmental controls (like cooling systems and waterproofing), using uninterruptible power supplies (UPS), and situating critical infrastructure in locations less prone to natural disasters.

### Expected Evidence
1. **Environmental Protection Policies**: Documented policies that outline the specific environmental protections in place for technology assets. This includes details on physical security measures, environmental controls, and disaster recovery strategies.

2. **Facility Audit Reports**: Reports from inspections or audits of physical facilities that house technology assets. These reports should assess the adequacy of environmental controls and compliance with safety regulations.

3. **Equipment Maintenance Logs**: Logs showing regular maintenance of environmental control systems such as HVAC, fire suppression systems, and backup power systems.

4. **Disaster Recovery Plans**: Copies of the organizationâ€™s disaster recovery plans that detail procedures for responding to environmental emergencies, including backup site locations and data backup strategies.

5. **Incident Response Records**: Documentation of any incidents related to environmental threats and how they were managed, demonstrating the effectiveness of the protective measures.

### Examples of Evidence
- **Environmental Security Guidelines**: A document detailing the standards for environmental protection, including specifications for temperature and humidity controls, water leakage detection systems, and fire suppression equipment.
- **Facility Safety Inspection Checklist**: A checklist used during facility audits that covers the inspection of environmental controls, emergency exits, power supply systems, and other relevant infrastructure.
- **HVAC System Maintenance Reports**: Detailed reports from the regular servicing of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems, showing dates, actions taken, and the technicians involved.
- **Backup Generator Test Logs**: Logs from monthly tests of backup generators and UPS systems to ensure they function correctly during a power outage.
- **Flood Response Drill Summary**: A summary report from a recent flood response drill, outlining the scenario, actions taken, effectiveness of response measures, and lessons learned.

By maintaining strict controls and comprehensive documentation for protecting technology assets from environmental threats, organizations can ensure the continuity and reliability of their operations. This proactive approach not only helps in mitigating the impact of environmental disasters but also supports compliance with safety standards and regulations.
