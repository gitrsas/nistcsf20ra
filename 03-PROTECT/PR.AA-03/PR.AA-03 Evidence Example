Control: PR.AA-03: Authentication of Users, Services, and Hardware

Plain Language Summary:
This control ensures that all users, services, and devices prove who they are before they can access the organization's systems. Authentication can involve entering a password, using a security token, biometric verification, or other methods that confirm an entity's identity based on previously registered credentials.

Expected Evidence:
Authentication Policy: A document that defines how authentication should be conducted, the types of authentication methods allowed, and under what circumstances they are required.

Authentication Mechanisms: Records or descriptions of the technical solutions and methods used to authenticate users, services, and devices.

System Configuration Files: Configuration files or settings that enforce authentication requirements on systems, applications, and network devices.

Login Logs: Records that show attempts and successes of user, service, or device authentications, including timestamps and access points.

Compliance Reports: Regularly generated reports that review and verify adherence to the authentication policies and procedures.

Examples of Evidence:
Policy Document: A comprehensive guide detailing required authentication methods for different levels of access (e.g., multi-factor authentication for administrators).

Technical Specifications: Documentation or vendor manuals for authentication systems used, such as biometric scanners or token-based authentication systems.

Configuration Snapshots: Screenshots or export files from systems showing that authentication methods are enabled and configured according to policy (e.g., password complexity requirements, session timeouts).

Audit Trail Extracts: Excerpts from security logs that document key authentication events, highlighting security relevant actions like multi-factor authentication usage and enforcement.

Compliance Audit Summaries: Summaries from internal or external audits that confirm the organizationâ€™s compliance with its own authentication standards and potentially applicable regulatory requirements.

This control is crucial for ensuring that access to the organization's resources is secure and controlled, by verifying that only verified and authorized entities can access sensitive data and systems.
