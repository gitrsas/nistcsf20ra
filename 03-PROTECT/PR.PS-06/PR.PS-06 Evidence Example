For the NIST CSF 2.0 control **PR.PS-06: Secure software development practices are integrated, and their performance is monitored throughout the software development life cycle**, hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown in simple terms, along with the types of evidence you should expect and examples:

### Plain Language Summary
This control focuses on ensuring that security is a core component of the software development process from start to finish. This includes integrating security best practices at every stage of designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software. The goal is to ensure software is secure by design, reducing vulnerabilities and the risk of security incidents post-deployment. Monitoring the effectiveness of these practices is also crucial to continually improve security measures.

### Expected Evidence
1. **Secure Development Policy and Guidelines**: Documented standards and guidelines that outline the security practices and requirements for all software development projects. This policy should detail the security measures to be integrated at each phase of the development lifecycle.

2. **Training Records**: Evidence that all development staff have received training on secure coding practices and are aware of the latest security threats and mitigation techniques.

3. **Security Tools and Processes Documentation**: Documentation of the tools and processes used to ensure security in the development process, such as static and dynamic code analysis tools, code review practices, and security testing procedures.

4. **Audit and Review Logs**: Logs that detail the outcomes of security audits, code reviews, and testing stages. These should include any vulnerabilities found and how they were addressed.

5. **Performance Monitoring Reports**: Regular reports that analyze the effectiveness of the security practices integrated into the development process. These might measure the frequency and severity of security issues discovered in released software and how quickly they are remediated.

### Examples of Evidence
- **Secure Coding Guidelines Document**: A comprehensive guide provided to all developers that outlines required security practices, such as input validation, encryption of sensitive data, and error handling.
- **Developer Training Logs**: Records showing completion of secure coding training sessions by the development team, including dates and the content of the training.
- **Tool Configuration and Usage Reports**: Documentation or screenshots from tools like SonarQube, Fortify, or Coverity that are used for static and dynamic analysis of code, showing how these tools are configured and examples of reports generated by them.
- **Code Review and Audit Reports**: Detailed reports from regular code reviews and security audits that highlight security issues and their resolutions.
- **Software Release and Incident Metrics**: Metrics that track security incidents associated with released software, including the nature of any security flaws, how they were exploited, and response times to fix them.

By maintaining strict controls and comprehensive documentation for integrating and monitoring secure software development practices, organizations can greatly enhance the security of their software products. This proactive approach not only minimizes the risk of security breaches but also fosters a culture of security within the development team.
