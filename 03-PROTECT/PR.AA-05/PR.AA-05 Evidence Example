Control: PR.AA-05: Management and Review of Access Permissions, Entitlements, and Authorizations

Plain Language Summary:
This control ensures that access rights (who can see what) are clearly defined, appropriately given out, managed regularly, and reviewed to make sure they are still correct. It stresses the importance of giving users only the access they need to perform their job (least privilege) and dividing critical functions among different people (separation of duties) to reduce the risk of fraud or error.

Expected Evidence:
Access Control Policy: A document detailing the organizationâ€™s rules for assigning, managing, and reviewing access rights, including how the principles of least privilege and separation of duties are applied.

Access Permission Records: Logs or databases that track what access rights are granted to which users, including details on the data or systems they can access.

Role Definitions and Assignments: Documentation showing how roles are defined within the organization and the specific access rights associated with each role.

Review and Audit Reports: Regular reports from reviews and audits of access controls, demonstrating compliance with the policy and noting any changes or violations.

Change Management Logs: Logs showing any changes to access rights, including who approved the changes, why they were made, and when.

Examples of Evidence:
Access Control Policy Document: A formal policy that specifies the requirements for granting access to systems and data, emphasizing the need for least privilege and separation of duties.

System Access Lists: Lists or screenshots from information systems showing user access levels, grouped by role or individual, highlighting the alignment with the defined access control policy.

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Configurations: Documentation or system configurations that define roles and the associated privileges, demonstrating how access is granted based on the user's job responsibilities.

Periodic Access Review Meeting Minutes: Meeting minutes or reports documenting periodic reviews of access rights, noting any adjustments made and the rationale behind them.

Audit Trail Records: Extracts from audit logs that capture changes in user access levels, including details on the administrator who made the change and any approval documentation.

This control plays a crucial role in safeguarding the organization's data and systems from unauthorized access and potential abuse, ensuring that access rights are granted in a controlled and justifiable manner.
